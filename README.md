### Take Home Assignment : 

The UI is made using React written in typescript.
there are multiple components in which the page is divided or can be divided such as Header, footer, Searchbar, Table....
The UI uses SASS for styling and use nested form of classes.
Different components can use diff styling files but since this is assignment is small a single scss file is created.
The styling is made taking care of the details provided in the figma. It also a uses a px to vh/vw function to make it resopnsive (Note: Due to time constraint some of the px were used as it is that can be updated to vh/vw.)

The table component uses the "react-table" package .
This package provides the table like layout .
With the table pagination, sorting(click the header in the table to change sort-asc/sort-desc ) and  searching (compares the name to the alphabet) are also implemented.

API calls are made according to use.
A modal was created to show details of a game for a team.
Note : Modal could have been a diffrent component depending on the need.

Test Cases are yet to be added.
Also the code is left to be cleaned.
